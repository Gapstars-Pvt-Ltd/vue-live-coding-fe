  [
  {
    "uuid": "811454a4-5640-497a-86da-077b211a7f97",
    "images": {
      "32x32": "https://storage.googleapis.com/dealroom-images-development/e0/MzI6MzI6Y29tcGFueUBzMy1ldS13ZXN0LTEuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9kZWFscm9vbS1pbWFnZXMvMjAyNC8wNC8zMC9iOGY3YjhlZjQ3M2E0NDlhZjI1OTQ0NDc1ZTgxZmE3Mw==.png",
      "74x74": "https://storage.googleapis.com/dealroom-images-development/23/NzQ6NzQ6Y29tcGFueUBzMy1ldS13ZXN0LTEuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9kZWFscm9vbS1pbWFnZXMvMjAyNC8wNC8zMC9iOGY3YjhlZjQ3M2E0NDlhZjI1OTQ0NDc1ZTgxZmE3Mw==.png",

    },
    "income_streams": [
      {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "subscription"
      }
    ],
    "industries": [
      {
        "id": 100147,
        "name": "enterprise software"
      }
    ],
    "name": "OpenAI",
    "tagline": "An AI research and deployment company working on artificial general intelligence and generative AI",
    "total_jobs_available": 58
  },
  ]


### Frontend Implementation

- [ ] Fetch the companies' data from the API.
- [ ] The card's title should be the industry name.
- [ ] Display the count of companies in that industry at the top right corner of the card.
- [ ] Implement the company grouping logic by industry on the frontend. Ensure that your implementation is optimized for scalability, particularly in handling large datasets.
- [ ] Use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to implement the card design. Refer to the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/9GvGhDV1Te6bQzS1GLoj8J/Dealroom-FE-Assessment?node-id=0%3A1&t=I6Ph4vb2EAvbkQQ7-1) for design specifications.
